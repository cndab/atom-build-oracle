# Oracle compiler for Atom

Uses the [atom-build](https://atom.io/packages/build) package to execute Oracle compilations in the Atom editor.

This package requires [atom-build](https://atom.io/packages/build) to be installed.

## Installation

First you will want to install the build package `apm install build`. Currently, this package has not been published to Atoms package repository. To install, clone the this repository to your atom package dir (`~/.atom/packages`). The repository name is not a 1-to-1 match to the plugin name, so it needs to be renamed to `build-oracle`. This can be done in the `git clone` command by specifying the distination directory. The output should be similar to:

```bash
$ cd ~/.atom/packages
$ git clone https://github.com/tschf/atom-build-oracle.git build-oracle
Cloning into 'build-oracle'...

remote: Total 142 (delta 8), reused 7 (delta 7), pack-reused 133
Receiving objects: 100% (142/142), 24.07 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (67/67), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

(Alternatively, you can clone the project elsewhere on the system and use the command `apm link atom-build-oracle`.)

After installation, you should be able to find it listed under community packages in the relevant settings page.

Once installed, you will want to access the settings and set the relevant path for your SQL interpreter. That will be either SQLcl or SQL*Plus. For me, I have `sqlplus` in my `path` so no change is necessary (there is an issue where PATH may not be correctly set in Atom, in that case you should set the full path of `sqlplus`). If I wanted to point it to the binary for `SQLcl`, which isn't in my `path`, I would set the configuration to `/opt/sqlcl/bin/sql`.

## Usage instructions

In your project root directory, add a JSON file named `.atom-build-oracle.json`, where you can define build targets for your project. This contents of the file should look like:

```json
[
    {
        "targetName" : "hr: dev",
        "host" : "example.com",
        "sid" : "xe",
        "port" : 1521,
        "user" : "hr",
        "password" : "hr"
    }
]
```

Where you can specify any number of build targets.
If your database server uses ServiceNames instead of SID, you can enter the ServiceName in the property "sid" nonetheless.

Since this file contains sensitive information (password) you will likely also want to add an entry to your `.gitignore` file so this is not published.

```conf
.atom-build-oracle.json
```

It's worth noting, that to get the build system to recognise the above configuration, you will need to reload atom (only the first time). This can be done in the menu `View->Reload` or with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+r`.

This plugin is an extension to the `build` system, providing the necessary scripts to compile Oracle code. The build triggers are determined as part of the over-arching `build` package. To build the active file is done with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+b` or `cmd+alt+b` or `f9`. By default, this will be the first entry in your build config file. The active build target can be switched with `f7`, which will also trigger a build on the active file:

The build panel (with build output) can be toggled with `f8`.
